# MOADSD-NG

> ***Note:*** This project has reached the end of its development. Feel free to browse the code and the wiki, but if you're looking for a kubernetes or public cloud playground, please use other projects like [c1-playground](https://github.com/mawinkler/c1-playground) or the [multi cloud shell](https://github.com/mawinkler/mcs).

The MOADSD-NG project does provide a simple way to setup a hybrid cloud security demo, playground and learning environment within the clouds. Core technologies used (besides of Trend Micro solutions) are the cloud native virtualization functionalities, a full-blown Kubernetes cluster with cluster storage and release management tools (Jenkins / GitLab).
Ansible, the de facto most used orchestration tool, is used for the whole life-cycle of your MOADSD-NG environment.

Please read the [Wiki](https://github.com/mawinkler/moadsd-ng/wiki).
